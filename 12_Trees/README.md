# This repo focuses on 'Tree' Data Structures

A Tree is a non-linear, heirarchical data structure and has a lot of applications.
A Binary Tree is a Tree wherein each node has at the most 2 children.
The technique to access the nodes of a Tree is known as 'Tree Traversal Technique'.

# Tree Traversal Techniques :

There are mainly 3 types of Tree Traversal Techniques as far as BST (Binary Search Tree) is concerned, viz., Inorder Traversal, Preorder Traversal & Postorder Traversal.

Inorder Traversal : 

left -> root -> right : Traverse all nodes in the left subtree, then the root , and finally, all the nodes in the right subtree.

Preorder Traversal : 

root -> left -> right : Traverse the root, then all the nodes in the left subtree, and finally, all the nodes in the right subtree.

Postorder Traversal : 

left -> right -> root : Traverse all the nodes in the left subtree, then traverse all the nodes in the right subtree, and finally access the root.
